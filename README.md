# Algorithmic Data Science Project

This repository contains an Algorithmic Data Science project focused on applying data preprocessing,
algorithmic modelling, and performance evaluation techniques using Python. The project demonstrates
an end-to-end data science workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation on unseen data.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build and evaluate predictive models using structured data.
The notebook covers key stages of the data science pipeline, including exploratory analysis,
feature engineering, model training, and quantitative performance assessment.

## Key Steps
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and transformation
- Model implementation using machine learning algorithms
- Performance evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R²
- Interpretation of results

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance is assessed using:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Coefficient of Determination (R²)

These metrics provide insight into prediction accuracy and model generalisation.


## Notes
- This project is intended for academic and portfolio demonstration purposes.
- The notebook is designed to run sequentially from top to bottom.
